<h2> <strong> My Opinion</strong> </h2>
<p>I think that social media has a negative impact on people
 and should not be used. Technology is not only invading personal
 privacy but it is also hurting the health of many people. I also feel as
 though it is taking away face-to-face socialization that I think is important.
 Some studies show that those who spend more time on social  media had 2.2 time more
 of a risk of having a eating or body image shaming compared to those who use social media less.</p>
